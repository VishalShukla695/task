# task
This function takes a dictionary ' D ' as input and returns a new dictionary output as output. It first initializes an empty object for the output dictionary and gets an array of keys from the input dictionary.
It then loops through each key in the input dictionary and does the following:

1 ) . Converts the key (which is a date string in the format yyyy-mm-DD) to a Date object and gets the day of the week (as a short string like "Mon" or "Tue").

2) . Adds the corresponding value from the input dictionary to the output dictionary for the current day of the week. If the current day of the week already has a value in the output dictionary, it adds the new value to the existing value.

3) . If the current key is not the first or last key in the input dictionary, it calculates the mean of the values for the previous and next days of the week (if they exist in the input dictionary) and sets the value for the current day of the week to this mean value if it doesn't already have a value in the output dictionary.
